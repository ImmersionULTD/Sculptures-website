                    Jews throughout Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear a 
                    badge in the form of a Yellow Star as a means of identification.
                    This was not a new idea; since medieval times many other
                    societies had forced their Jewish citizens to wear badges to identify themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The star was intended to humiliate Jews and to mark them
                    out for segregation and discrimination. The policy also made it easier
                    to identify Jews for deportation to camps.
